<p><img src="images/search.jpg" alt="Search for a Node" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> </p>
<p>	Use either Ctrl + F or mouse click to focus in the search field. Type in the Node Label you are looking for, and it will select the node in the interface.
</p>
<p>

<p><a name="NodeFilter"><font color="#008080"><strong>Node Filtering by Depth</strong></font></a></p>
<p>1. Right click on a desired node. You will see the following:<br>
	a. A drop down menu will appear with multiple options<br>
	b. Ties related to the selected node will become colored. The colors correspond to the type of link. Outgoing links are red,
	incoming links are green, and mutual links are blue.
</p>

<p>2. Use the menu to navigate the options you would like to select. Click on the desired depth (originating from that node) to show a
smaller version of the original network based around this focal node. If you would like a depth greater than 4, click on ‘Other’ and specify a larger number.
</p>

<p><a name="RelationFilter"><font color="#008080"><strong>Filter Relation Type</strong></font></a></p>
<p><b>Filter Relations Based upon one Node</b></p>
<p>Right click on a desired node. You will see a drop down menu as shown in <a href="#NodeFilter"> Node Filtering by Depth </a>. To filter by incoming, outgoing, mutual,
or undirected links, click on ‘Show Selected Link.’ This window
below will appear. Check the ties you would like to show and click 'Show'. The network will be filtered accordingly.</p>
