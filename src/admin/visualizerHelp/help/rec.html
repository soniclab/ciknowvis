CIKNOW’s recommendation tools use network data to provide algorithm-based recommendations for both resource discovery and team assembly. The Resource function allows a
user to query a complete list of recommended pathways to any other node or attribute in the network. The Team Assembly function allows a user to assemble a
team from nodes in the network based upon specified node attributes and relational characteristics.
<p>
This section provides functions for recommendation network visualization. You may see the buttons on the right side of the toolbar like <img src="images/recNTButton.jpg" alt="NodeType based Rec" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> if the
recommendation network is based on Node Type. The buttons will be <img src="images/recAtButton.jpg" alt="NodeType based Rec" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> if the
recommendation network is based on Attribute.
<p>


<p><a name="NodeType"><font color="#008080"><strong>Recommendation Based on Node Type</strong></font></a></p>
<p>Click the <img src="images/rec.gif" alt="Recommendation Based on Node Type" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> button, a recommendation layout will be displayed like this:
</p>
<p><img src="images/recLayout_NT.jpg" alt="recLayout_NT" ALIGN=MIDDLE /></P>
<p>The node colored red is the "requestor" of the recommendation, the node colored green is the "recommendation" and the node colored yellow is the "target" of the recommendation.
</p>


<p>If you want to see paths with <b>one more step</b> between the "requestor" and the "recommendation" as well as between the
"recommendation" and the "target",  click the <img src="images/Icon_ShortestPath.gif" alt="hidden path" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> button.
</p>
<p>



<p><a name="Attribute"><font color="#008080"><strong>Recommendation Based on Attribute</strong></font></a></p>
<p>Click the <img src="images/recCircle.gif" alt="Recommendation Based on Attribute" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> button, a recommendation layout will be displayed similar to this:
</p>
<p>

<p><img src="images/recLayout_At3.jpg" alt="recLayout_At3" ALIGN=MIDDLE /></P><p>
<p>The bigger node colored red is the "requestor" of the recommendation, the node colored green is the "recommendation". The dotted circles indicate how many steps from the
requestor to the recommendation. The straight dotted line means there is no direct recommended relations, but only not recommended relations between the requestor and the recommendation.
When mouse hovers over the dotted line, the not recommended relations will be displayed as following:
</p>
<p>

<p><img src="images/recLayout_At4.jpg" alt="recLayout_At4" ALIGN=MIDDLE /></P><p>
<p>We can see, for this case, there are three direct relations between requestor and the recommendation, but those relations are not recommended. To see the recommended relations
between the requestor and the recommendation, hover or click the recommendation node (green node), and you will get the visualization as following.
Click any blank space on the screen and you will be back to the dotted line.
</p>
<p>

<p><img src="images/recLayout_At5.jpg" alt="recLayout_At5" ALIGN=MIDDLE /></P><p>
<p>All the paths from requestor to recommendation are by way of intermediary nodes. If you want to show more than one recommendation network on the same screen, just select the recommendation node
you want. See <a href="other.html#Selection">Node Selection and Deselection </a> to learn how to select your desired node(s).
</p>
<p>

<p><img src="images/recLayout_At6.jpg" alt="recLayout_At6" ALIGN=MIDDLE /></P>
<p>
<p>The above shows all the recommended relations for three recommendations at the same screen.
</p>
<p>


<p>The visualizer also provides a function to see relations which are not recommended, click the <img src="images/Icon_ShortestPath.gif" alt="hidden path" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> button to do so.
</p>
<p>



<p><a name="Why"><font color="#008080"><strong>Recommendation Description</strong></font></a></p>
<p>The button <img src="images/qu.jpg" alt="Recommendation Description" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> triggers a window the describes why this node is recommended. The contents of this
description are similar to this:
</p>
<p>

<p><img src="images/why-dia.jpg" alt="Why description" ALIGN=MIDDLE /></P><p>
