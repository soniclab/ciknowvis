<table width=98% border=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr valign="top">
<td width=20%><b><font color="#008080">Nodes:</font></b>
</td>
<td width=80%>
Nodes are shown as rounded-rectangles that are colored based upon either nodetype or attribute or focal node (egonetwork only).

<tr valign="top">
<td width=20%><b><font color="#008080">Edges:</font></b>
</td>
<td width=80%>
Edges are the lines that connect nodes to one-another. The relations of the edges can be direct relations, undirect relations, or mutual relations.
The arrows tell which way the relations go (if the visualization is for a directed graph).

The legend is on the right hand of the window. In the legend, it will tell you which colors signify which node properties and which edges are which relation.
