CI-KNOW Visualizer implements several standard and customized layouts. Circle layout positions nodes in the network as a circle. It helps to show the well-connected networks. Clustering layout help to show which nodes are well-connected with each other and which nodes are not closely connected with the group.
RadialTree layout computes a radial layout based on a single root node and displays the subsequent depth levels as a tree. It displays how far the other nodes are to the root.

<p><a name="CircleLayout"><font color="#008080"><strong>Put Nodes In a Circle</strong></font></a></p>

<p>Click the <img src="images/circle.gif" alt="Put Nodes In Circle" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> icon in the toolbar; this command organizes the nodes into a circular configuration.</p>

<p>
<p><a name="RandomLayout"><font color="#008080"><strong>Randomly Scatter Nodes</strong></font></a></p>

<p>Click the <img src="images/random.gif" alt="Randomly Scatter Nodes" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> icon in the toolbar; this command randomly scatters the nodes.</p>

<p>
<p><a name="ClusterLayout"><font color="#008080"><strong>Automatically Cluster Network</strong></font></a></p>

<p>This function clusters the network based either on separating existing components or by clustering around the largest component.
If you click the button <img src="images/anneal.gif" alt="Automatically Cluster Network" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> in the toolbar, the visualization will show the default
view--"Structural View"-- to cluster the components around the largest component.
It is possible, however, to choose this manually by using the "Automatically Cluster Network" menuItem from the "Layout" Menu.

<p>By clicking the menuItem, a dialog box will be generated and you can choose either "Component view" or "Structural view". Component view spreads the components throughout the window by using as much of the space as possible. Structural
view places one large component in the middle, and it occupies most of the space. The rest of the components are placed in the periphery, circled around the large central component. Changing the distance between two
nodes effects the visualization. A bigger distance preset makes it easier to see the structure of the network, while a shorter distance makes it easier to see the components.</p>


<p>

<p><a name="TreeLayout"><font color="#008080"><strong>Put Nodes in a Radial Tree</strong></font></a></p>

<p>By clicking the <img src="images/tree.gif" alt="Put Nodes in Radial Tree" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> icon, all other nodes will be arranged around a selected focal node in the middle of the visualization.</p>

<p>To perform this layout, you must first select a node as the root node, after you select a node, this node will be highlighted.
<p>

<p><a name="GroupLayout"><font color="#008080"><strong>Group Nodes by Attribute</strong></font></a></p>

<p>By pressing the <img src="images/group.gif" alt="Group Nodes by Attribute" ALIGN=MIDDLE /> icon, all nodes will be grouped based upon their colored attribute.</p>
<p>If you do not want to see all the groups, you can choose which groups you want to show from the generated dialog box.
